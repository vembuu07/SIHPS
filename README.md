## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Title: "Addressing the Growing Challenge of E-Waste: A Call to Action for Sustainable Management"

## Problem Statement:
The proliferation of electronic devices has led to a corresponding surge in electronic waste (e-waste), presenting a multifaceted challenge that demands urgent attention. As the Ministry of Environment, it is imperative to acknowledge the adverse environmental and human health impacts associated with improper disposal and inadequate management of e-waste.

## Key Issues
1.Rapid Growth
2.Environmental Hazards
3.Resource Depletion
4.Informal Recycling Sector
Propossed Solutions
1.Awareness and Education
2.Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
3.Infrastructure Development
4.Formalization of Informal Sector

## Idea

E-waste management plays an important role in protecting :

Environment
Conserving resource
promoting a healthier and safer world.
By reducing, reusing, and recycling electronic devices, we can make a positive impact and pave the way for a sustainable future.

## Use Cases

## Consumer Education and Awareness:
Use Case: A mobile application that educates consumers about e-waste management, providing information on how to properly dispose of electronic devices, where to recycle them, and the environmental impacts of improper disposal.

## E-Waste Collection and Recycling:
Use Case: A community-based e-waste collection program where residents can schedule pickups for their old electronics or drop them off at designated collection points.

## Corporate Responsibility and EPR Compliance:
Use Case: A multinational electronics manufacturer implements an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program, where they take responsibility for the end-of-life disposal of their products. The company offers buy-back or trade-in programs for old devices, refurbishes and resells them, and ensures that any remaining e-waste is recycled in accordance with regulatory standards

## Informal Sector Integration and Capacity Building:
Use Case: A government-led initiative aimed at formalizing and integrating informal e-waste recyclers into the formal waste management sector. The program provides training on safe handling and recycling techniques, access to protective gear and equipment.

## Policy Development and Stakeholder Engagement:
Use Case: A coalition of government agencies, industry stakeholders, NGOs, and academia collaborates to develop comprehensive e-waste management policies and regulations. The coalition conducts stakeholder consultations, policy analysis, and impact assessments to ensure that the policies are practical, effective, and inclusive.

## Technology Stack

## Mobile Applications:
Platform: iOS, Android

Description:
Develop mobile applications for consumers to schedule e-waste pickups, locate nearby collection points, access educational resources, and track the lifecycle of their disposed electronics. Additionally, create applications for field workers to log collection data, scan barcodes, and communicate with the central management system.

## Cloud Infrastructure:
Platform: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

Description:
Utilize cloud infrastructure for scalable storage, computing, and data management. Store collected e-waste data, recycling records, customer information, and analytics results in cloud databases. Leverage cloud-based services for real-time data processing, predictive analytics, and machine learning algorithms.

## Internet of Things (IoT) Devices:
Sensors: RFID, GPS, weight sensors

Description:
Deploy IoT devices on e-waste collection bins, vehicles, and recycling facilities to track the movement of e-waste throughout the supply chain. Use RFID tags to identify and categorize items, GPS trackers for route optimization and monitoring, and weight sensors for accurate measurement of collected e-waste.
